Key Initiatives,,,,,
"Develop the CRD Digital Core: Create the infrastructure, databases and robust workflows to empower our line SMEs to deliver impactful CRD Digital Tools. ",,,,,
"Embed model led experimental design into our workflows: Enable machine aided experimentation, autonomous calculation of results and machine led follow-on experiments.",,,,,
Parameterize eLN data capture and automate report generation,,,,,
Enable Digitally-driven / Predictive Product Design Workflows,,,,,
Integrate SMART initiatives - Increase lab productivity and enhance improvements in identified focus areas  ,,,,,
"Predictive and Adaptive modelling, simulation, real-time monitoring and control capabilities ",,,,,
Create DPD scientific domain in a computationally accessible fashion such that algorithms and tools can be developed around them,,,,,
"Increase the amount, quality and access of DPD data captured in eLN, the SDC, Redshift and associated databases using automated storage and access of data in “live” format to integrate with modelling tools.",,,,,
"Predictive Sciences & Modeling Increased deployment and embedding of predictive science modelling in workflows, filing and publications",,,,,
"Develop capability for efficient and structured data capture, sample + instrument management.",,,,,
Championing data standardisation to accelerate execution of core workflows  ,,,,,
Real-time end-to-end analytical workflows for API and DP advanced manufacturing platforms,,,,,
Electronic batch records ,,,,,
Real Time Access to Data and Seamless Integration,,,,,
FAST,,,,,
Demand Planning/Scheduling Stack – Develop and Launch Scheduling/Demand Planning/Sourcing/Procurement/ WH Automation system with improved Business Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence ,,,,,
"Creation of Mfg Data Warehouse – enable single access point to all key information across PSSM that relates to manufacturing.  Easily accessible, managed and enables self service platform.",,,,,
"Clinical Manufacturing Execution System Stack - Integrated Mfg Execution System across multiple systems (EBR, Eqp Mgt, Inv Mgt, Process Intelligence, eQMS)  ",,,,,
"Leverage our PSSM Asset Tagging initiative to create “SMART Assets” across our lab and manufacturing operations.  These assets will proactively provide a warning if moved into a restricted area, flag maintenance schedules, training requirements, safety/PPE information, equipment scheduling, etc.",,,,,
"Creation of a digital SOE Resource Center where relevant information (data/metrics, guides, etc.) is automatically populated for all of the processes managed by SOE (e.g., AT, P2L, eln compliance, capital)",,,,,
"Develop and deliver the vast majority of PSSM training through X-Reality (XR) tools, improving the availability, quality, and retention of training offered to PSSM colleagues  ",,,,,
Data Analytics / Reporting / Visualization,,,,,
Project Management and Planning,,,,,
Project Document Management,,,,,
